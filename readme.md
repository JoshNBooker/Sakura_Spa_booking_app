This is a flask-based webapp produced as part of a the CodeClan professional Software Developer course.

Brief

A customer (don’t worry about multiple users just yet, we can pretend this is already within a user being logged in) wants to be able to book wellness treatments at their favourite spa.

MVP
A customer should be able to create a Booking with a name, date, time, and Treatment. A customer should be able to see all their scheduled treatments and click through on one to edit it or cancel it. A Treatment can just have a name.

Extensions:
• Date and time could be handled as date type instead of as strings
• A treatment could have a length of time
• Could you try preventing double booking?

To run:

Clone the repository to your local machine by using the command line:

git clone git@github.com:Joshbuuker/Sakura_Spa_booking_app.git

Make sure you have Python installed and available from the command line:

Install dependencies from the command line:

pip install Flask
pip install python-dotenv
Install PostgreSQL

Create the database

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project:

Add the following lines of code to the .env file and insert your own database information:

USER = "postgres"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
DATABASE = "database_name"
Run the following lines from the command line:

flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
If you would like to seed the database with some starter values, run the following from the command line:

flask seed
To run the app from the command line:

flask run
Open the link generated by the command line in a web browser (this is usually localhost:5000)

Run with the below settings:

FLASK_RUN_HOST=127.0.0.1
FLASK_RUN_PORT=4999
